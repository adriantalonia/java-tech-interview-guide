# Module 2: SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are fundamental for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

### 2.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

### 2.2 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### 2.3 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the
program.

### 2.4 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

### 2.5 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
