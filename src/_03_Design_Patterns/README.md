# Module 3: Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. Knowing them demonstrates experience and good practices.

## 1. Creational Patterns
* **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
* **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
* **Abstract Factory**: Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **Builder**: Lets you construct complex objects step by step.
* **Prototype**: Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

## 2. Structural Patterns
* **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
* **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
* **Composite**: Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
* **Decorator**: Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects.
* **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
* **Proxy**: Provides a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## 3. Behavioral Patterns
* **Observer**: Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
* **Strategy**: Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
* **Command**: Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
* **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
* **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
* **State**: Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
