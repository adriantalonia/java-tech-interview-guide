# Module 1: Java Fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This module is crucial to ensure a solid foundation before delving into more advanced topics. 2

## 1.1 Review of Java Fundamentals

* Basic syntax, data types, operators.
* Flow control (conditionals, loops).
* Classes and objects: Instantiation, constructors, this.
* Encapsulation: Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default).
* Inheritance: extends, super, method overriding (@Override).
* Polymorphism: Method overloading, upcasting, downcasting.
* Abstract classes and interfaces: Differences and use cases.
* Exceptions:try-catch-finally, throws, checked vs. unchecked exceptions.
* Java Collections (introduction): List, Set, Map (basic concepts).
* Generics: Use and benefits.
* Streams API (introduction): Basic operations.
* Lambdas: Syntax and basic use.

## 1.2 Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism. 
* Composition vs. Inheritance: When to use each.
